title: Disallow game actions during pause
desc: |-
  I assume that the desired behaviour during pause is that tower building
  should be disallowed during pause.  One could argue that this should not
  cover information requests like hovering on an enemy.  Modifications
  of the game state are surely a bad thing, though.
