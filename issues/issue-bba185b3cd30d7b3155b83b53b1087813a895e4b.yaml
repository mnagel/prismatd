    Actually one just needs to settle on a fixed directory for the export.
    Afterwards you can just symlink the screenshots directory to the right
    location.  Of course installations from that export need to actually
    copy the screenshots directory instead of taking the symlink.  So one
    other solution would be to regenerate the screenshots subtree on
    every make instead.
